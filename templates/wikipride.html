                <h4>What does LGBTQ+ mean?</h4>
                <p>
                    LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQ+ and LGBTQIA+ are all acronyms which aim to describe as inclusively as possible the members of the LGBTQ+ community. It stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), intersex and ally (or asexual). The + denotes all the members of the community not defined in these letters. Sexual orientation and gender are constantly evolving, and so too is the language to ensure inclusivity.
                    The following is a brief guide to the commonly used identities and orientation, but definitely is not a complete list:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lesbian refers to women who are attracted to other women.</li>
                        <li>Gay is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a person that is attracted to other people of the same gender, but typically refers to men.</li>
                        <li>Bisexual refers to someone who is attracted to people of their own and other genders. Though this term can be interpreted as reinforcing a male/female gender binary that restricts inclusivity.</li>
                        <li>Transgender is a broad term used to describe a person whose gender differs to the biological sex they were born with.</li>
                        <li>Queer doesn't have an exact definition, and means different things to different people. A broad description would be it's a very inclusive term which includes people who are not heterosexual and don't feel comfortable using, or that they fit into, some of the more defined orientations. It was previously used as a slur, but has been reclaimed by the community.</li>
                        <li>Questioning refers to a person still exploring and defining their gender identity and/or sexual orientation.</li>
                        <li>Intersex is a person born with biological sex characteristics that aren’t traditionally associated with male or female bodies. </li>
                        <li>Asexual refers to people who experience little or no sexual attraction. </li>
                        <li>An ally is a heterosexual cisgender person who actively supports the LGBTQ+ community and aims to help the movement gain equal rights, gender equality and challenges anti-LGBTQ ideals.</li>
                        <li>Pansexual refers to a person who is attracted to people of all gender identities. This is a term preferred by those that feel like bisexual assumes gender binary. </li>
                        <li>Nonbinary is a person who doesn't identify as male or female, and uses they/them pronouns.</li>
                        <li>Gender fluid refers to a person who identifies and presents as male and female at different times.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                                    The first pride flag created by artist Gilbert Baker in 1978. A rainbow was chosen as it is recognised as a symbol of hope.<br>
                                    Each colour has a different meaning:<br>
                                    Pink: Sex <br>
                                    Red: Life <br>

                                    The pink and turquoise colours were dropped to make the flag easier to mass produce.
                                    It still stands as a symbol of love and pride, and is often used by businesses to show their support.

                                    This flag was updated by Daniel Quasar to include the colours of the trans flag (pink, white, blue),
                                    and the black and brown colours give representation to the marginalised people of the community.
                                    The arrow shape shows that progress needs to be made, but we are moving in the right direction.

                            Unsure who created it, but it has gathered favour and attention over the last 10 years as a
                            symbol of attraction to all genders.<br>
                            Blue: attraction to males <br>
                            Pink: attraction to females<br>

                            This flag was created by JJ Poole to represent the people whose gender identity
                            shifts.<br>

                            This flag was created by Morgan Carpenter to represent intersex people and break down the incorrect stereotypes.<br>
                            The gold/yellow was chosen after being inspired by a story they were told
                            to reclaim the hermaphrodite slur.<br>
                            The purple circle represents a community which is unbroken; whole and complete.<br>

                            The rainbow colours represent the LGBTQIA+ community, in the shape of an ‘A’ to represent allies.

                            Noting that queer people of color are often not fully included in the
                            LGBT community, the city of Philadelphia added two colors — black and brown — to the Pride flag in their honor.
                            This represents the black and latin communities of Philedelphia. While only intended for Philedelphia,its popularity
                            took off worldwide.
